# Lab 3, 4, and Final

This repository holds labs 3, 4, and the final. Each lab was a progression on the previous so modules and components were reused in each iteration. This way, it was simpler to "rewire" the components to demonstrate each of the additional functionality.

> MIPS CPU -> Multicore CPU -> GPU

## Rust

The Rust crate designed for the lab allows execution of the Verilog as a static binary with some test fixtures to make testing modules and the CPUs 

## Lab 3

Lab 3 is an implementation of the MIPS CPU in Verilog.

## Lab 4

Lab 4 details the construction of a SIMD Core.

## Lab 5

Lab 5 (the final project) details the constrction of a basic multicore GPU from a set of SIMD cores.
